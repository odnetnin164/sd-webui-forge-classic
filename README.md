<blockquote><i>
<b>Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge</b> is a platform on top of the original <a href="https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui">Stable Diffusion WebUI</a> by <ins>AUTOMATIC1111</ins>, to make development easier, optimize resource management, speed up inference, and study experimental features.<br>
The name "Forge" is inspired by "Minecraft Forge". This project aims to become the Forge of Stable Diffusion WebUI.<br>

<br>

"**Neo**" mainly serves as an continuation for the "`latest`" version of Forge, which was built on [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio) `4.40.0` before lllyasviel became too busy... Additionally, this fork is focused on optimization and usability, with the main goal of being the lightest WebUI without any bloatwares.

## Commandline
> These flags can be added after the `set COMMANDLINE_ARGS=` line in the `webui-user.bat` *(separate each flag with space)*

#### A1111 built-in

- `--xformers`: Install the `xformers` package to speed up generation
- `--port`: Specify a server port to use
    - defaults to `7860`
- `--api`: Enable [API](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/API) access

<br>

- Once you have successfully launched the WebUI, you can add the following flags to bypass some validation steps in order to improve the Startup time
    - `--skip-prepare-environment`
    - `--skip-install`
    - `--skip-python-version-check`
    - `--skip-torch-cuda-test`
    - `--skip-version-check`

> [!Important]
> Remove them if you are installing an Extension, as those also block Extension from installing requirements

#### by. Forge

- For RTX **30** and above, you can add the following flags to slightly increase the performance; but in rare occurrences, they may cause `OutOfMemory` errors or even crash the WebUI; and in certain configurations, they may even lower the speed instead
    - `--cuda-malloc`
    - `--cuda-stream`
    - `--pin-shared-memory`

- `--forge-ref-a1111-home`: Point to an Automatic1111 installation to load its `models` folders
    - **i.e.** `Stable-diffusion`, `text_encoder`

#### by. Neo

- `--uv`: Replace the `python -m pip` calls with `uv pip` to massively speed up package installation
    - requires **uv** to be installed first *(see [Installation](#installation))*
- `--uv-symlink`: Same as above; but additionally pass `--link-mode symlink` to the commands
    - significantly reduces installation size (`~7 GB` to `~100 MB`)

> [!Important]
> Using `symlink` means it will directly access the packages from the cache folders; refrain from clearing the cache when setting this option

- `--forge-ref-comfy-home`: Point to an ComfyUI installation to load its `models` folders
    - **i.e.** `diffusion_models`, `clip`

- `--model-ref`: Points to a central `models` folder that contains all your models
    - said folder should contain subfolders like `Stable-diffusion`, `Lora`, `VAE`, `ESRGAN`, etc.

> [!Important]
> This simply **replaces** the `models` folder, rather than adding on top of it

- `--sage`: Install the `sageattention` package to speed up generation
    - will also attempt to install `triton` automatically

> [!Note]
> For RTX **50** users, you may need to manually [install](#install-sageattention-2) `sageattention 2` instead

- `--flash`: Install the `flash_attn` package to speed up generation
- `--fast-fp16`: Enable the `allow_fp16_accumulation` option
    - requires PyTorch **2.7.0** +

<details>
<summary>with SageAttention 2</summary>

- `--sage2-function`: Select the function used by **SageAttention 2**
    - **options:**
        - `auto` (default)
        - `fp16_triton`
        - `fp16_cuda`
        - `fp8_cuda`

- If you are getting `NaN` errors, try:
```bash
--sage2-function fp16_cuda --sage-quant-gran per_warp --sage-accum-dtype fp16+fp32
```

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Haoming02/sd-webui-forge-classic sd-webui-forge-neo --branch neo
    ```

2. Setup Python

<details>
<summary>Recommended Method</summary>

- Install **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation)**
- Set up **venv**
    ```bash
    cd sd-webui-forge-neo
    uv venv venv --python 3.11 --seed
    ```
- Add the `--uv` flag to `webui-user.bat`

</details>

<details>
<summary>Standard Method</summary>

- Install **[Python 3.11.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3119/)**
    - Remember to enable `Add Python to PATH`

</details>

3. **(Optional)** Configure [Commandline](#commandline)
4. Launch the WebUI via `webui-user.bat`
5. During the first launch, it will automatically install all the requirements
6. Once the installation is finished, the WebUI will start in a browser automatically

<br>

### Install sageattention 2

<details>
<summary>Expand</summary>

0. Ensure the WebUI can properly launch already, by following the [installation](#installation) steps first
1. Open the console in the WebUI directory
    ```bash
    cd sd-webui-forge-neo
    ```
2. Start the virtual environment
    ```bash
    venv\scripts\activate
    ```
3. Create a new folder
    ```bash
    mkdir repo
    cd repo
    ```
4. Clone the repo
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention
    cd SageAttention
    ```
5. Install the library
    ```
    pip install -e . --no-build-isolation
    ```

    - If you installed `uv`, use `uv pip install` instead
    - The installation takes a few minutes

<br>

### Alternatively
> for **Windows**

- Download the pre-built `.whl` package from https://github.com/woct0rdho/SageAttention/releases
```bash
pip install sageattention...win_amd64.whl
```
- If you installed `uv`, use `uv pip install` instead
- **Important:** Download the correct `.whl` for your PyTorch version

</details>

### Install older PyTorch

<details>
<summary>Expand</summary>

0. Navigate to the WebUI directory
1. Edit the `webui-user.bat` file
2. Add a new line to specify an older version:
```bash
set TORCH_COMMAND=pip install torch==2.1.2 torchvision==0.16.2 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

</details>

### Install FFmpeg

<details>
<summary>Expand</summary>

> for Windows

1. Download the FFmpeg [.7z](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-essentials.7z)
2. Extract the contents to a folder of choice
3. Add the `bin` folder within to the system **PATH**
    - `Edit the System Environment Variables` > `Environment Variables` > `Path`
4. Verify the installation by entering `ffmpeg` in a command prompt

</details>

<br>

## Attention

> [!Important]
> The `--xformers` and `--sage` args are only responsible for installing the packages, **not** whether its respective attention is used *(this also means you can remove them once the packages are successfully installed)*

**Forge Neo** tries to import the packages and automatically choose the first available attention function in the following order:

1. `SageAttention`
2. `FlashAttention`
3. `xformers`
4. `PyTorch`
5. `Basic`

> [!Tip]
> To skip a specific attention, add the respective disable arg such as `--disable-sage`

> [!Note]
> The **VAE** only checks for `xformers`, so `--xformers` is still recommended even if you already have `--sage`

In my experience, the speed of each attention function for SDXL is ranked in the following order:

- `SageAttention` ≥ `FlashAttention` > `xformers` > `PyTorch` >> `Basic`

> [!Note]
> `SageAttention` is based on quantization, so its quality might be slightly worse than others

<br>

## Issues & Requests

- **Issues** about removed features will simply be ignored
- **Issues** regarding installation will be ignored if it's obviously user-error
- Non-Windows platforms will not be officially supported, as I cannot verify nor maintain them
